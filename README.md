# sqlalchemy-challenge

My name is Sean Weeks, this is my submission repository for the Module 10 Challenge

This repository contains a Jupyter Source File containing the analysis of climate data in reference to the hawaii.sqlite file and a Python Source file that operates as a Climate App. The Resources folder contains our hawaii.sqlite (as well as its CSV files that contains Hawaii's measurements and stations data) and two other CSV files that details the most active station and percipitation data for the first 12 months.
